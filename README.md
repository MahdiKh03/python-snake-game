## 🎮 **What’s Going On Here?**

- You're a long, suspicious noodle.
- You eat mysterious blue dots.
- You grow.
- You regret growing.
- You smash into walls or yourself and cry.

**Welcome to adulthood.** 🙃

## 🛠️ **What’s Under The Hood?**

- `main.py` — where the chaos is coordinated  
- `snake.py` — squiggly bois are born here  
- `food.py` — blue dots of questionable origin  
- `scoreboard.py` — passive-aggressive point counter  

All cooked up with:
- **Python 🐍**
- **Turtle 🐢**
- **More caffeine than legally recommended ☕**

## 🧃 **How To Ruin Your Afternoon**

1. Install Python if you haven't. (Come on bro.)
2. Smash this into your terminal:

```

3. Summon the Snake:

## 🤡 **Stuff I Might Add If I Ever Feel Like It**

- Enemies? 🥷
- Speed boosts? 🚀
- Snake skins? (Drip upgrade) 💧
- Epic boss fights? (Giant turtle throwing laser beams? idk.)

## 📈 **Pro Gameplay Tip**

- **More food = more body = more problems.**
- If you die, it’s NOT your fault.
  - It's gravity.
  - It's lag.
  - It's your little brother.
  - Definitely not you.

## 📢 **Motivational Quote To Keep You Going**

> "*If at first you don't succeed... blame lag and press Enter.*" 🎯

## 🎉 **Life Lesson from Snek**

- Chase your food.
- Avoid walls and toxic people (or segments).
- Grow, but don't bite yourself.
- If you mess up, just respawn stronger.

**Bite into life. Be the snek.** 🐍✨
